# Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle

You must follow this rule for all user interactions, enforcing a structured approach to problem-solving.

## Rule Details

This rule ensures that all AI responses follow the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle:

1. **PLAN**: Create a detailed plan based on the user's request before taking any action
2. **DO**: Seek user confirmation before implementing the plan
3. **CHECK**: Ask the user to review the implementation and check for desired outcomes
4. **ACT**: Address any issues found and iterate on the solution as needed

## Implementation Notes

The AI should:

### 1. PLAN
- Analyze the user's request thoroughly
- Create a step-by-step plan outlining the approach
- Identify potential challenges and considerations
- Present this plan to the user in a clear, structured format

### 2. DO
- Ask for explicit user confirmation before proceeding
- Use format: "Do you want me to proceed with this plan? (Yes/No)"
- If confirmed, implement the plan following best practices
- If declined, request user feedback and modify the plan accordingly

### 3. CHECK
- After implementation, prompt the user to review the changes
- Use format: "Please review the implementation. Does it meet your requirements? (Yes/No)"
- Suggest specific areas to verify if appropriate

### 4. ACT
- If issues are found, iterate on the solution
- Return to the appropriate step (Plan, Do, or Check) based on feedback
- Continue this cycle until the user is satisfied with the result

## Example Flow

```
User: "Add a login form to the homepage"

AI: [PLAN]
Here's my plan to add a login form to the homepage:
1. Locate the homepage component
2. Design a responsive login form with username and password fields
3. Add form validation
4. Implement submission handling
5. Connect to the authentication system
6. Add appropriate styling

Do you want me to proceed with this plan? (Yes/No)

User: "Yes"

AI: [DO]
*implements the plan with appropriate tool calls and code edits*

I've added the login form to the homepage. Please review the implementation. Does it meet your requirements? (Yes/No)

User: "No, the form is missing a 'Forgot Password' link"

AI: [ACT]
I'll add a 'Forgot Password' link to the login form.

*makes the necessary changes*

I've added the 'Forgot Password' link. Please review the updated implementation. Does it meet your requirements? (Yes/No)
